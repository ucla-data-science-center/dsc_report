I am to scrape data from five different stan communities (those of BTS, Taylor Swift, and Travis Scott) by choosing 5 ""influencer stans"" or popular stan accounts from each community and then running the accounts through a combination of Python and OAuth to retrieve a data set on them. I was to search for things like certain hashtags, the word ""stream,"" and links to streaming platforms. I don't have a lot of coding literacy, but I would love help on making this happen.

Data Analysis
Coding/Programming|Currently involved in my capstone thesis with the global studies department and trying to grasp some basic data collection and analysis foundation in order to better support my research. Maybe in need of some 'R' assistance. Not completely sure what is best for my project. My question is: How does the role of monetary sovereignty intersect with the power political considerations of the UNSC agenda? Is there a systematic correlation between the politics of the UNSC and a nation's status as a currency issuer or a currency user? My (potential) hypotheses are: H1: Monetary Sovereigns are more likely to be elected as nonpermanent members to the UNSC.
H1a: Monetary Sovereigns are more likely to jump the order of the turn-taking-norm for the Africa Regional Group
H2: Monetary Sovereigns are more likely to have their conflicts adopted on the agenda. 
H2a: Monetary Sovereigns are also more likely to have their conflict adopted to the agenda at a quicker pace.

Coding/Programming|Currently involved in my capstone thesis with the global studies department and trying to grasp some basic data collection and analysis foundation in order to better support my research. Maybe in need of some 'R' assistance. Not completely sure what is best for my project. My question is: How does the role of monetary sovereignty intersect with the power political considerations of the UNSC agenda? Is there a systematic correlation between the politics of the UNSC and a nation's status as a currency issuer or a currency user? My (potential) hypotheses are: H1: Monetary Sovereigns are more likely to be elected as nonpermanent members to the UNSC.
H1a: Monetary Sovereigns are more likely to jump the order of the turn-taking-norm for the Africa Regional Group
H2: Monetary Sovereigns are more likely to have their conflicts adopted on the agenda. 
H2a: Monetary Sovereigns are also more likely to have their conflict adopted to the agenda at a quicker pace.

I was speaking to my library mentor, Wynn Tranfield, about being interested in taking a GIS class during my time at UCLA (my background being in environmental science, and I took 1 GIS class that wasn't too structured in my undergrad program) and she thought you would likely be more knowledgeable about the different offerings and their applications.

In both of those courses, I am working with a Twitter dataset that I collected for my dissertation project. The trouble is that the data I scraped through an encoded google sheets workbook (TAGs) contains approx 2 million cells with some form of textual data or metadata. I have attempted to download the sheet as a .csv file however, upon opening it in excel, the non-latin characters become illegible (characters are not recognized and I am working with both Hindi and English language/along with some regional languages). If I download it as an excel file, the file takes extremely long to open. I was able to copy the content from the tweets column into a .txt file, however, again, I am unable to split it into workable portions. The copying and pasting process doesn't work out too well because the file is too long. I also tried loading the excel workbook into Open refine but for some reason Open refine tells me that it does not recognize the file. I wonder if it is because of the encoding because of TAGs. I reached out to both of my instructors regarding this issue and they suggested I reach out to you.

I would like assistance from you in terms of splitting up the excel file and the .txt file into workable pieces that don't overtax my macbook air too much. Below I am attaching the excel sheet that contains my Twitter Archive, so you can have a sense of what I am working with. My goal is to conduct topic modeling on the data collected in this file.

Data Wrangling and Cleaning|Looking for text version of Series episcoporum Ecclesiae catholicae (a list of bishops by city and date). Archive.org has a good scan and Hathi Trust has an OCR but it's a bit messed up (eg, it shows Linus before Peter in the list of popes). The Hathi scan has good contrast but is a bit off kilter whereas the Archive scan is dead on but less contrast and the opposite side of the leaf bleeds through.

Ultimately, I need to get the earliest bishop date for each city through the middle ages. So the end product would be column one city, column two date. This may or may not involve a fresh OCR. I have some background with regular expressions and the like, but it's been awhile.

Of course if there's already a clean CSV somewhere that's even better.

Geospatial data/GIS|Hi Zhiyuan it's Anvita again! I am still working on my project where I am trying to spatially visualize air pollution data and food desert data in the cities of Inglewood and Santa Monica in GIS. I just had a meeting with the librarian Gillian Bailey and she said for a question I had regarding how to visually illustrate the presence of food deserts in these cities it is best to ask you for help since the FIPS code is missing a zero before it otherwise it would be able to track the data for each census tract in the data. She also asked for me to review what I've made with her (air pollution concentration maps of Inglewood and Santa Monica) with you in another meeting. Thus I hope this meeting won't be too redundant but I do still need clarification. Additionally, I was wondering if it's possible if our meeting could be recorded so I can refer back to it later on?

Data Wrangling and Cleaning
Data Analysis|We're a group of students from the biology department working on a project looking at the use of the word 'evolve' in online news articles related to COVID. We also want to look at use for alternative words for evolution that appear in articles, i.e., mutate, appear, arise. We found a coronavirus corpus (https://www.english-corpora.org/corona/) that contains all online news media on COVID, and so is the perfect database, but we're unsure how to use a corpus. One hurdle we have is how to select articles that would include the words 'evolve' and/or an alternative word, and how to get a random, unbiased selection and have enough lists for our search to be significant. We'd prefer to meet with someone who has experience working with linguistic corpuses.

My name is Megan and I'm with the Covid Behind Bars project out of UCLA Law. I think you've spoken with past project members Hope Johnson and Cece Bobbitt. I'm reaching out, along with our project director Bennett Stein to ask about ICPSR and UCLA. I've seen that you're the contact for the school, and as we explore archiving our data there, I've come up against a few questions, such as 
- Would you recommend depositing to Open ICPSR?
- Do you recommend paying for curation? What does it cost?
- General archiving questions
So I'm hoping to discuss some of that with you in a meeting. Thanks!

Data Sharing and Publishing|Research Topic: Real Estate Ownership in the Black and Native Communities, its Relation to Web3 Digital Estate Ownership, & its Correlation to the Creation of Generational Wealth

Description: 
     I would like to conduct a research project as an undergraduate.
     I have an interest in analysing data regarding the rates of real estate ownership in the Black American and First Nation communities. Specifically in North America, with a preference towards analyzing the Western-Pacific region, (as long as this preference won’t limit my grad school prospects).
     I am also incredibly interested in how these ownership rates may or may not translate to digital estate ownership with the creation and impending rise of web3. 

     The core relevance of my project is tracking and (an attempt at) proving a correlation between ownership rates in these markets and generational wealth/income level.
     I am very concerned about whether or not my research topic is compelling enough to be awarded funding, and would like further instruction/assistance on how to communicate that this research will be “useful” to the modern world.
     Any guidance you could provide me on constructing a compelling research proposal regarding this topic(s), and resources to execute the project, would be greatly appreciated.

Resources so far: 
1. Most of my resources have been in-person primary accounts of personal experiences. Direction towards any online databases or collections is needed and will be appreciated.

2. Report: The Road to Zero Wealth report published by Prosperity Now and the Institute for Policy Studies.",,,,,,zyao@library.ucla.edu,db34e5d8-710b-4d08-8fc2-dccf81e9446e,event-data-from-2021-01-06-to-2023-03-03.csv,,

I would like to learn how to write a script (i don't care whether bash or python or ??) to use existing string data in a spreadsheet to create a new column and value for each row. Basically, I have an identifier field in each row, and that's the unique component of a resulting URL to access that item. I'd like to loop through the spreadsheet and create a new column that says Access URL and appends the unique id to a constant. I could probably do this on my own, but I would appreciate a mentor",,,Please add a link to your data and/or code if possible.,I can provide a link via Google sharing when I know who I'll be working with.

I'd like to create something like a Shiny app to display this visualization with up-to-date data, or at least learn how best to collect and clean that data. I have a rudimentary understanding of Python and have decent skills in R (good with stats, not-so-good with coding). I can share the viz when we meet!

I should highlight that this project was a little off the cuff and limited by both a time crunch and my coding skills, but I'd love to expand on it over the summer. 

Thanks so much! Looking forward to talking further. :)

The first phase consisted of 3 trials, each with 16 facial stimuli pairs. Participants were instructed to choose whether the image pair was the “same” or “different.” Afterwards, a sum of 16 images appeared in a randomized order, 8 of which did not appear in previous trials. Subjects were instructed to choose whether the image was presented in a previous trial (“old”) or not (“new”). Participants were then asked to complete a self-report survey to assess international travel frequency and enjoyment of travel. A scale of 1-5 was used, with 5 indicating the highest travel frequency and enjoyment.

I hypothesized that those with higher travel frequencies will correctly assess outgroup members more often than those who do not travel. I also hypothesized that participants will recognize ingroup members more often than outgroup members during recall. ",,,,,,zyao@library.ucla.edu,7ae423ee-b979-4516-b7fa-2d86dd338217,event-data-from-20230601-to-20240515.csv,,

I want to merge data from the variables folder to my dataset connected by the census tracts. I am planning on having a data set that is for the year 2010 and the year 2020, so you will find that under each variable folder i have 2020 and 2010 data from the census. 

My goal is to end up doing a difference in difference analysis so i'm just trying to figure out the best way to merge this data.

I have developed a rudimentary dashboard in Excel to illustrate when we are outside a preservation standard for temperature/relative humidity, but since I do not have a statistics background, I know I am limited for data analysis. I would like to be able to look at the relationship between outside air and our recorded conditions, impact from events (ie: equipment failures, upgrades/added items, HVAC shutdowns), and reflect on the annual trends we're seeing in different seasons. Below is an example of one location, but we are scaling this across multiple buildings. I can explain more of the logic and what I was trying to achieve.

My supervisor has already found this helpful to describe a sample of the felt-conditions of our collection and quantifying our seasonal challenges, but I believe my prototype needs improvement.

I've already correlated census tracts to neighborhoods and computed some basic averages for different areas of burden.

United States|i am conducting a research project on the varied experiences with self-care among Asian American activists and how these practices affect the larger Asian American social justice movement.  

Data will be: 10 interviews (transcript / qualitative coding) 
survey of 100 respondents

 I'm thinking of doing cross-tab for my google spreadsheet, do you have a recommended method of analyzing simple quantitative data? In addition to basic demographic data, my survey asks certain quantitative questions such as: 
- likert scale of understanding of self care
- likert scale of prioritizing others' needs over your own
- # of hours spent organizing/activism in 2020 vs 2024",,,Please add a link to your data and/or code if possible.,"cannot link data as it is confidential.
