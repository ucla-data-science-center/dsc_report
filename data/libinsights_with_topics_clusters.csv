I want to merge data from the variables folder to my dataset connected by the census tracts. I am planning on having a data set that is for the year 2010 and the year 2020, so you will find that under each variable folder i have 2020 and 2010 data from the census. 

My goal is to end up doing a difference in difference analysis so i'm just trying to figure out the best way to merge this data.

i have developed a rudimentary dashboard in excel to illustrate when we are outside a preservation standard for temperature relative humidity  but since i do not have a statistics background  i know i am limited for data analysis  i would like to be able to look at the relationship between outside air and our recorded conditions  impact from events  ie  equipment failures  upgrades added items  hvac shutdowns   and reflect on the annual trends we re seeing in different seasons  below is an example of one location  but we are scaling this across multiple buildings  i can explain more of the logic and what i was trying to achieve 

my supervisor has already found this helpful to describe a sample of the felt conditions of our collection and quantifying our seasonal challenges  but i believe my prototype needs improvement  i do not have a statistics background  but a strong interest in making sure we have a useful tool that isn t misguiding our department   statistical consultation Topic 3"
