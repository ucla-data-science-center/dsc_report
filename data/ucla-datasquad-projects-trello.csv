  - A Tableau Public dashboard template that shows a visual map of collaborators, as well as a few other views to explore the data

The imports are kind of glitchy and we do _not_ want to compile on import (the “building wheel” log is a note that is compiling, we want to just download the binary).

Confirm able to run tutorial, as is.

Next step:

Document what are value arguments for

`infer = MMOCRInferencer(det='dbnetpp', rec='aster')`

det and rec values – Text Detection and Text Recognition models.

I _think_ they are a combination of values (but in lowercase) from the MMOCR modelzoo page, but would like to verify possible values
