data wrangling  cleaning looking for text version of series episcoporum ecclesiae catholicae  a list of bishops by city  date   archive org has a good scan  hathi trust has an ocr but it s a bit messed up  eg  it shows linus before peter in the list of popes   the hathi scan has good contrast but is a bit off kilter whereas the archive scan is dead on but less contrast  the opposite side of the leaf bleeds through 

ultimately  i need to get the earliest bishop date for each city through the middle ages  so the end product would be column one city  column two date  this may or may not involve a fresh ocr  i have some background  regular expressions  the like  but it s been awhile 

of course if there s already a clean csv somewhere that s even better

data sharing  publishing research topic  real estate ownership in the black  native communities  its relation to web  digital estate ownership    its correlation to the creation of generational wealth

description  
     i would like to conduct a research project as an undergraduate 
     i have an interest in analysing data regarding the rates of real estate ownership in the black american  first nation communities  specifically in north america   a preference towards analyzing the western pacific region   as long as this preference won t limit my grad school prospects  
     i am also incredibly interested in how these ownership rates may or may not translate to digital estate ownership  the creation  impending rise of web   

     the core relevance of my project is tracking   an attempt at  proving a correlation between ownership rates in these markets  generational wealth income level 
     i am very concerned about whether or not my research topic is compelling enough to be awarded funding   would like further instruction assistance on how to communicate that this research will be  useful  to the modern world 
     any guidance you could provide me on constructing a compelling research proposal regarding this topic s    resources to execute the project  would be greatly appreciated 

resources so far  
   most of my resources have been in person primary accounts of personal experiences  direction towards any online databases or collections is needed  will be appreciated
